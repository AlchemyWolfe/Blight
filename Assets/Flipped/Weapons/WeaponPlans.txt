We have currently built the ability to increase:
* damage
* size
* speed
* parallel shots
* followup shots
* explosions

This can get us:
Player Main gun: increases damage and size on level up
- Suped up main gun, increase parallel, tight spacing.
Player Dual Shot: starts with 2 parallel shots, slow rof, increases number of followup shots on level up
Player Cannon: large, a little slower, high damage.  increased levels increases followup and damage.
Boss Shot: slow moving and huge
Enemy 3 burst: 2 followup shots, rof of 20 seconds

Things to add:

Triggered explosion:
Traps: speed 0, level increase increases damage and area of effect
Grenades: level increase increases number thrown

Parallel shots in an angle, need to store and use the angles.
Player Wide Shot: each level up adds 2 to parallel
Enemy burst: Set to something like 60 or 90 degrees, with 3 or 4 parallel shots, slow rof

Seeking shots:
Player Seekers: increase in level increases parallel shots

Spawners: (create a BlightCreature when fired)
Player: create a wolf cub who tracks and... bites?  Might need to look into that.

OnDeath:
Enemy explodes when dead
Enemy breaks into smaller creatures when dead

Freeze: (visual effect, freeze movement/attacking for all blight creatures)
Player shot that causes enemies to stop moving and stop attacking

Fire: (visual effect, continuous damage)
Player shot that sets enemies on fire
