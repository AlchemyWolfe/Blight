Currently waves can:
Determine a spawn style
Determine an enemy movement style
Assign a weapon
Require a minimum wave number
Set a spawn number at initial wave and wave 100

In Theory we can also make boss waves.

I would like to add some behaviors:
CreatureType: 2nd creature that is 1 random in set.
SpawnPlacement: One random angle
MovementType: seek player
MovementType: stagger
OnDamage: Increase Size
OnDamage: Teleport
OnDamage: Spawn Enemy
Bomb: Do one attack, after a countdown
